  <strong>Project Summary</strong><br>
  During my third year of undergrad, My group of 5 was tasked with building a full application (with front end & back end) to demonstrate our abilities to implement good software engineering practices. Frankly: this project fell far from my expectations & was far from my finest work, but I still feel publically archiving my dumpsterfire will do me well in showing anyone on this repo how much progress I have made in this adventure of learning to code & the lessons I have learnt along the way.
